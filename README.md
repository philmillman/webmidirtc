# webmidirtc

This project is meant to demonstrate controlling hardware synths using Web MIDI (via [Webmidi.js](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi)) over a WebRTC video call (using [Daily](https://daily.co).)

This initial version was designed to be used with Elektron's Digitakt and Digitone. See [MIDI-Setup](#hardware-and-midi-setup) below for the hardware specific configuration. 

You can find MIDI command mappings in [`controlMap.js`](src/lib/controlMap). 

Most of the logic lives in [`Main.vue`](src/components/Main.vue) for now. It will get moved into smaller components in the future. 

> This is definitely a work in progress, so PRs are welcome. 

## Hardware and MIDI Setup 

This was tested with the following configuration: 

- Digitakt and Digitone plugged in separately via USB 
- Digitone sending transport controls 
- Digitakt receiving transport controls
- Digitakt main outputs going into Digitone inputs 
- Digitone MIDI Out going into Digitakt MIDI In 

You can see a list of available MIDI controls for these devices [here](https://midi.user.camp/d/elektron/).
